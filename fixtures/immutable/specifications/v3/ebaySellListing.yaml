      description: This call gives Partners the ability to create an eBay draft of a
        item for their seller using information from their site. This lets the
        Partner increase the exposure of items on their site and leverage the
        eBay user listing experience seamlessly. This experience provides
        guidance on pricing, aspects, etc. and recommendations that help create
        a listing that is complete and improves the exposure of the listing in
        search results. After the listing draft is created, the seller logs into
        their eBay account and uses the listing experience to finish the listing
        and publish the item on eBay.

            increments in between this range (e.g. 10, 15, 20...95,... 100). The

            percent, and so on, all the way to 100 for 100 percent. Note: For
            this field, createItemDraft will only validate that a positive
            integer value is supplied, so the listing draft will still be
            successfully created (with no error or warning message) if a
            non-supported value is specified. However, if the seller attempted
            to publish this listing draft with an unsupported value, the charity

            you can use the getItemConditionPolicies method of the Metadata API.
            Note: The 'Manufacturer Refurbished' item condition is no longer a
            valid item condition in any eBay marketplace, and to reflect this
            change, the pre-existing MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED enumeration value
            has been replaced by the CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED enumeration value.
            CR-eligible sellers should make a note to start using
            CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED from this point forward. To list an item as
            'Certified Refurbished', a seller must be pre-qualified by eBay for
            this feature. Any seller who is not eligible for this feature will
            be blocked if they try to create a new listing or revise an existing
            listing with this item condition. Any seller that is interested in
            eligibility requirements to list with 'Certified Refurbished' should
