        ApiSpecs provide formal descriptions that consumers can use to use a
        version. ApiSpec resources are intended to be fully-resolved
        descriptions of an ApiVersion. When specs consist of multiple files,
        these should be bundled together (e.g. in a zip archive) and stored as a
        unit. Multiple specs can exist to provide representations in different
        API description formats. Synchronization of these representations would
        be provided by tooling and background services.
