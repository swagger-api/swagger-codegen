# Swagger Codegen
![Swagger Codegen Logo](./docs/Swagger-Codegen-Logo.png)

This is the Swagger Codegen project, which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs and documentation automatically given an [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

üíö If you would like to contribute, please refer to [guidelines](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and a list of [open tasks](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).üíö

üìî For more information, please refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki) and [FAQ](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/FAQ) üìî

‚ö†Ô∏è If the OpenAPI Description or Swagger file is obtained from an untrusted source, please make sure you've reviewed the artefact before using Swagger Codegen to generate the API client, server stub or documentation as [code injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection) may occur. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Versioning

> ‚ö†Ô∏è this document refers to version 2.X, check [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/3.0.0) for 3.X.

Both **2.X** and **3.X** version lines of Swagger Codegen are available and are independently maintained.

**NOTES:**

- Versions 2.X (`io.swagger`) and 3.X (`io.swagger.codegen.v3`) have **different** group ids.
- OpenAPI 3.0.X is supported from the 3.X version only.

## Compatibility

The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 3 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  The **current stable** versions of Swagger Codegen project have the following compatibilities with the OpenAPI Specification:

Swagger Codegen Version    | Release Date | Swagger / OpenAPI Spec compatibility | Notes
-------------------------- |--------------| -------------------------- | -----
[3.0.65](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases/tag/v3.0.65) (**current stable**) | 2024-12-18   | 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0   | [tag v3.0.65](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/v3.0.65)

üíÅ Here's also an overview of what's coming around the corner:

Swagger Codegen Version    | Release Date | Swagger / OpenAPI Spec compatibility | Notes
-------------------------- |--------------| -------------------------- | -----
3.0.66-SNAPSHOT (current 3.0.0, upcoming minor release) [SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/swagger/codegen/v3/swagger-codegen-cli/3.0.66-SNAPSHOT/)| TBD          | 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0 | Minor release

For detailed breakdown of all versions, please see the [full compatibility listing](./docs/compatibility.md).

### Getting Started

To get up and running with Swagger Codegen, check out the following guides and instructions:

- [Prerequisites](./docs/prerequisites.md)
- [Building](./docs/building.md)
- [Using Docker](./docs/docker.md)

Once you've your environment setup, you're ready to start generating clients and/or servers.

As a quick example, to generate a PHP client for https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json, you can run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen
cd swagger-codegen
mvn clean package
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate \
   -i https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
   -l php \
   -o /var/tmp/php_api_client
```

**Note:** if you're on Windows, replace the last command with

```sh
java -jar modules\swagger-codegen-cli\target\swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json -l php -o c:\temp\php_api_client
```

You can also download the JAR (latest release) directly from [maven.org](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/swagger-codegen-cli/2.4.44/swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.44.jar)

To get a list of **general** options available, you can run the following:

```sh
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar help generate
```

To get a list of PHP specified options (which can be passed to the generator with a config file via the `-c` option), please run

```sh
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar config-help -l php
```

## Generators

### To generate a sample client library

You can build a client against the swagger sample [petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io) API as follows:

```sh
./bin/java-petstore.sh
```

(On Windows, run `.\bin\windows\java-petstore.bat` instead)

This will run the generator with this command:

```sh
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate \
  -i https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -l java \
  -o samples/client/petstore/java
```

with a number of options. You can get the options with the `help generate` command (below only shows partial results):

```text
NAME
        swagger-codegen-cli generate - Generate code with chosen lang

SYNOPSIS
        swagger-codegen-cli generate
                [(-a <authorization> | --auth <authorization>)]

                [(-t <template directory> | --template-dir <template directory>)]
                [--type-mappings <type mappings>...] [(-v | --verbose)]

OPTIONS
        -a <authorization>, --auth <authorization>
            adds authorization headers when fetching the swagger definitions
            remotely. Pass in a URL-encoded string of name:header with a comma
            separating multiple values

...... (results omitted)

        -v, --verbose
            verbose mode

```

You can then compile and run the client, as well as unit tests against it:

```sh
cd samples/client/petstore/java
mvn package
```

Other languages have petstore samples, too:
```sh
./bin/android-petstore.sh
./bin/java-petstore.sh
./bin/objc-petstore.sh
```

### Generating libraries from your server
It's just as easy--just use the `-i` flag to point to either a server or file.

üîß Swagger Codegen comes with a tonne of flexibility to support your code generation preferences. Checkout the [generators documentation](./docs/generators.md) which takes you through some of the possibilities as well as showcasing how to generate from local files and ignore file formats.

### Selective generation

You may not want to generate *all* models in your project.  Likewise you may want just one or two apis to be written. If that's the case check the [selective generation](./docs/generation-selective.md) instructions.


### Advanced Generator Customization

There are different aspects of customizing the code generator beyond just creating or modifying templates.  Each language has a supporting configuration file to handle different type mappings, or bring your own models. For more information check out the [advanced configuration docs](./docs/generators-configuration.md).

### Validating your OpenAPI Spec

You have options.  The easiest is to use our [online validator](https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge) which not only will let you validate your spec, but with the debug flag, you can see what's wrong with your spec.  For example check out [Swagger Validator](http://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json).

If you want to have validation directly on your own machine, then [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) is an excellent option.

### Generating dynamic html api documentation

To do so, just use the `-l dynamic-html` flag when reading a spec file.  This creates HTML documentation that is available as a single-page application with AJAX.  To view the documentation:

```sh
cd samples/dynamic-html/
npm install
node .
```

Which launches a node.js server so the AJAX calls have a place to go.

### Generating static html api documentation

To do so, just use the `-l html` flag when reading a spec file.  This creates a single, simple HTML file with embedded css so you can ship it as an email attachment, or load it from your filesystem:

```sh
cd samples/html/
open index.html
```

## Workflow Integration

It's possible to leverage Swagger Codegen directly within your preferred CI/CD workflows to streamline your auto-generation requirements. Check out the [workflows integration](./docs/workflow-integration.md) guide to see information on our Maven, Gradle, and GitHub integration options. üöÄ
