# Selective Generation

You may not want to generate *all* models in your project.  Likewise you may want just one or two apis to be written.  If that's the case, you can use system properties to control the output:

The default is generate *everything* supported by the specific library.  Once you enable a feature, it will restrict the contents generated:

```sh
# generate only models
java -Dmodels {opts}

# generate only apis
java -Dapis {opts}

# generate only supporting files
java -DsupportingFiles

# generate models and supporting files
java -Dmodels -DsupportingFiles
```

To control the specific files being generated, you can pass a CSV list of what you want:

```sh
# generate the User and Pet models only
-Dmodels=User,Pet

# generate the User model and the supportingFile `StringUtil.java`:
-Dmodels=User -DsupportingFiles=StringUtil.java
```

To control generation of docs and tests for api and models, pass false to the option. For api, these options are  `-DapiTests=false` and `-DapiDocs=false`. For models, `-DmodelTests=false` and `-DmodelDocs=false`.
These options default to true and don't limit the generation of the feature options listed above (like `-Dapi`):

```sh
# generate only models (with tests and documentation)
java -Dmodels {opts}

# generate only models (with tests but no documentation)
java -Dmodels -DmodelDocs=false {opts}

# generate only User and Pet models (no tests and no documentation)
java -Dmodels=User,Pet -DmodelTests=false {opts}

# generate only apis (without tests)
java -Dapis -DapiTests=false {opts}

# generate only apis (modelTests option is ignored)
java -Dapis -DmodelTests=false {opts}
```

When using selective generation, _only_ the templates needed for the specific generation will be used.

## Ignore file format

Swagger Codegen supports a `.swagger-codegen-ignore` file, similar to `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` you're probably already familiar with.

The ignore file allows for better control over overwriting existing files than the `--skip-overwrite` flag. With the ignore file, you can specify individual files or directories can be ignored. This can be useful, for example if you only want a subset of the generated code.

Examples:

```sh
# Swagger Codegen Ignore
# Lines beginning with a # are comments

# This should match build.sh located anywhere.
build.sh

# Matches build.sh in the root
/build.sh

# Exclude all recursively
docs/**

# Explicitly allow files excluded by other rules
!docs/UserApi.md

# Recursively exclude directories named Api
# You can't negate files below this directory.
src/**/Api/

# When this file is nested under /Api (excluded above),
# this rule is ignored because parent directory is excluded by previous rule.
!src/**/PetApiTests.cs

# Exclude a single, nested file explicitly
src/IO.Swagger.Test/Model/AnimalFarmTests.cs
```

The `.swagger-codegen-ignore` file must exist in the root of the output directory.

Upon first code generation, you may also pass the CLI option `--ignore-file-override=/path/to/ignore_file` for greater control over generated outputs. Note that this is a complete override, and will override the `.swagger-codegen-ignore` file in an output directory when regenerating code.

Editor support for `.swagger-codegen-ignore` files is available in IntelliJ via the [.ignore plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7495--ignore).
